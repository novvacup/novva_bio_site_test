## Menstrual cups are reusable, cost-effective, and eco-conscious. But they can be difficult to use.
##     

## Many menstruating individuals never try menstrual cups or quit their use:
## 20% have difficulties with insertion
## 9% have removal issues
## And 11% stop use altogether
##    

## We believe modern menstruation requires modern solutions.
## We are building a better menstrual cup.
