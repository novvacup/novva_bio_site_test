# What drives us

**We believe in science.** Our team is the next generation of doctors, engineers, and scientists. We use data-driven prototyping and manufacturing practices to ensure that our products are supported by the latest findings in medicine and science. We believe that fostering a culture guided by biomedical research provides customers with period products that are held to the highest standards of health and safety.


**We embrace innovative technology and healthcare.** We believe that thoughtful engineering and innovative thinking can reshape the period product market. We are committed to providing period products that go beyond feminine hygiene and contribute to the OB-GYN/O&G healthcare of our customers. Our innovative products support the overall well-being of our customers while being easy to use and cost-effective.


**We are committed to sustainability.** By developing sustainable solutions for the period product market, we are promoting consumer behavior to reduce, reuse, and recycle. Our reusable products are more eco-friendly than traditional period products by reducing single-use waste from going into landfills and having a lower carbon footprint.


**We advocate for equity and inclusivity.** We recognize that menstruation does not always correlate to feminine identity. That is why we aim to provide period products for all identities of menstruating individuals. To grow our inclusive community, we design our business model around the contribution to efforts in menstruation education and healthcare empowerment for all menstruating individuals.
